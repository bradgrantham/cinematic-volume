* Handle DICOM-specified scale and bias on data
* Use a better FOV
* Allow click-scroll and scroll-wheel to zoom
* Allow moving the light
* Shadows
* Partial transparency
* Read DICOM and then get images directly
* Throw exceptions for all failures and catch them
* Use <iostream> and <format> and as little printf as possible
* Do gradient at lookup time? -> will better match a shader
* Do what preprocessing?
* Use a Vulkan shader
* Better manipulator - need touchpad two-finger drag to zoom
